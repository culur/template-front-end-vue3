    title: About Animal Race
    subtitle: '#ANIMAL-RACE'
    content: | 
              Global warming, forest fires, deforestation created by our own human hands have gradually taken away the homes and lives of many wild animals.
              
              And also many times we have come across images of wild animals running away from their beloved homes being engulfed in flames.

              Understanding the pain of animals, our team created a click to earn game called Animals Racing to both spread the message of caring about the environment and protecting the lives of animals.

              Also at the same time help people who are participating in the cryptocurrency market to earn their own income

        content: |
                  It's always been a mystery how strong I am. The redhaired horse was ridden on its back, but I wasn't.

                  It's possible that I'm not the quickest. However, myths have always been used to glorify me.

                  I don’t know anything about the world of ants; the peaks of mountains are oblivious of what is happening on the plains!

                  My advantage is not in my legs, but in this long neck. My necks will reach the finish line before they even start running.
